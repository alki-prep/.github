## 🚫 Say Goodbye to Inefficient Practices

Are you still relying on spreadsheets and manual tracking for your LeetCode practice? It's time for an upgrade:

- ❌ No more endless Excel sheets with long lists of problems
- ❌ No more manual calculation of review times
- ❌ No more disorganized practice routines
- ❌ No more ineffective long-term retention strategies

Alki revolutionizes your prep by addressing these pain points head-on!

## 🧠 The Science of Remembering: Spaced Repetition

Alki harnesses the power of spaced repetition, a learning technique scientifically proven to enhance long-term memory retention. It is also a technique used by medical students and professionals all around the world! Here's why it's game-changing for mastering LeetCode problems:

1. **Fight the Forgetting Curve**: Our brains naturally forget information over time. Spaced repetition counteracts this by reviewing material at increasing intervals, solidifying knowledge in your long-term memory.

2. **Efficient Learning**: Instead of wasteful cramming, Alki optimizes your study schedule, ensuring you review problems at the perfect moment – not too soon, not too late.

3. **Personalized to Your Brain**: Everyone's memory works differently. Alki adapts to your individual retention rates, creating a truly personalized learning experience.

4. **Confidence in Interviews**: By systematically reinforcing your knowledge, you'll walk into coding interviews with solutions fresh in your mind, ready to tackle any problem with ease.

## 🌟 What is Alki?

Alki, derived from "algorithm" and "Anki," is your key to mastering LeetCode problems and acing tech interviews.
